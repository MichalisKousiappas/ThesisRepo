Thesis

This repo will have all my thesis files so i can keep track.

To compile you need to install libczmq or libzmq.
if you build it from source dont forget to include it in the `PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR`

Then run ./build \<file name with no extention\> or use the Makefile inside the folders.

folder initial_tries has the first attempts to learn the zeromq library and its APIs

folder common_coin is the actual project
